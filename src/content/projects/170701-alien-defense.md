Welcome to **Alien Defense**, my first video game! This project was built using the Phaser.io library (version 2.8.3). I designed and programmed everything from scratch.

## Overview

### How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** to move.
- Note: The volume cannot be adjusted (sorry about that! ðŸ˜¬).

Enjoy the challenge and defend the planet!
